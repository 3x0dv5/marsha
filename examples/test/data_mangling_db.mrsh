# func get_employee_skills(list of EmployeesByDepartment, list of DepartmentSkills): list of EmployeeSkills

This function receives a list of EmployeesByDepartment and a list of DepartmentSkills. The function should be able to create a response of EmployeeSkills merging the 2 list by department. Use the pandas library.

* get_employee_skills() = throws an error
* get_employee_skills([EmployeesByDepartment('Joe', 'Accounting')]) = throws an error
* get_employee_skills([], []) = []
* get_employee_skills([EmployeesByDepartment('Joe', 'Accounting')], []) = []
* get_employee_skills([], [DepartmentSkills('Accounting', 'math')]) = []
* get_employee_skills([EmployeesByDepartment('Joe', 'Accounting')], [DepartmentSkills('Accounting', 'math')]) = [EmployeeSkills('Joe', 'math')]
* get_employee_skills([EmployeesByDepartment('Joe', 'Accounting'), EmployeesByDepartment('Jake', 'Engineering')], [DepartmentSkills('Accounting', 'math')]) = [EmployeeSkills('Joe', 'math')]
* get_employee_skills([EmployeesByDepartment('Joe', 'Accounting'), EmployeesByDepartment('Jake', 'Engineering')], [DepartmentSkills('Accounting', 'math'), DepartmentSkills('Engineering', 'coding')]) = [EmployeeSkills('Joe', 'math'), EmployeeSkills('Jake', 'coding')]

# func connect_to_db(postgres connection string): connection

This function connects to a postgres database using the connection string received and using the sqlalchemy orm. It should return a connection object.

* connect_to_db() = throws an error for no argument
* connect_to_db('') = throws an error for empty connection string
* connect_to_db('postgresql://user@localhost:5432/mydb') = conn


# func main(postgres connection string): list of EmployeeSkills

This function will get the connection object calling `connect_to_db` and passing the connection string. It will then select tables EmployeesByDepartment and DepartmentSkills, call the `get_employee_skills` function and return the list of EmployeeSkills generated.

* main('postgresql://user@localhost:5432/mydb') = [EmployeeSkills('Joe', 'math'), EmployeeSkills('Jake', 'coding')]
